<p>One of the most powerful tools in Kig are the menus that you can
enter by right-clicking on an object, or on some empty space in the
document.  You can use them to give objects names, change their colors
and line styles, and lots of other interesting things.</p>

<p>You can construct new points without using the menu or the toolbar, simply
clicking somewhere on the Kig document with the <em>middle mouse
button</em>.</p>

<p>You can use the selected objects to start the construction of an object
which requires the selected objects as arguments. For example, if you have two
points selected, you can choose <em>Start->Circle by Three Points</em> from the
popup menu to start constructing a circle by three points.</p>
