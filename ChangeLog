		point->transform->now.. 

2003-05-09  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

	* the drawLocus is now changed to function as a generic drawCurve.
		The changes are very little, and the locusCalcPoint is no
		longer necessary.  It seems that performance is not affected
		significantly.  The drawCubic is not used any longer; it is
		still there in kigpainter, but can be purged as soon as
		no problems arise with the new setup.  The generic drawCurve
		is used in place of drawCubic.
