2004-04-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Various i18n'able string fixes.

	* Add some documentation to the functions in misc/conic-common.h

	* Rename "Cubic" to "Cubic Curve", as discussed with Maurizio
	Paolini and Jaap Woldringh.

	* Save and load line and point styles in the native format.  Most
	of the code comes from Pino.

2004-04-19  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* More work in Dr. Geo filter.

	* A new cool (I hope :) ) icon for Python Script.

	* Some various improvements.

2004-04-17  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix the calculation of the rectangle containing the entire
	document ( which is used for centering on the document ), to take
	into account non-point objects.  This is accomplished by adding a
	surroundingRect function to ObjectImp, and by implementing it
	properly for all objects that can have such a thing.

2004-04-15  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* More work in Dr. Geo filter: add a new object and simplifying a
	bit his internal structure.

	* Kig now ask the user what to do when he/she tries to save to
	a file in another format than Kig's own.

	* Improve Python scripting's API: add vectors, angles and arcs.

	* Add i18n for TestConstructor's.

	* Improved NewScriptAction class to support, without other
	changes, other scripting languages.

	* Some little here-and-there improvements

2004-04-11  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Improve Kig embedded in Konqueror experience: make translations
	and icons work by using the correct instanceName(), and using the
	iconLoader we get from our KInstance instead of from KGlobal ( so
	that the kig specific dirs are checked for icons as well ).

2004-04-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Enable the DrGeo input filter.

2004-04-10  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* Improved angle size editing, making possible choosing between
	degrees, radians and gradians.

	* More work in Dr. Geo filter.

	* Some improvements in Goniometry class

2004-04-08  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* More work on types dialog: a new dialog will allow to edit
	types that now work in read-only mode.

	* Add a 'cross' style for points.

	* Some very minor work in Dr. Geo filter.

	* Add a new simple class to easily work with goniometric
	measures, and adapt Kig to use this class.

	* Some #include fixes

2004-04-05  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* A new look for type list in the type dialog: a listview instead
	of a listbox that should make easier editing a type.

2004-04-04  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* Now Kig can save icon information of every macro.

	* Some work on types dialog: icon of every type is now visible,
	and made a sort of skeleton to modify type's data.

	* Made buttons of some dialogs like other KDE dialogs ones (with
	icons and correct alignment).

	* Kig now ask the user when exporting type(s) to an already
	existant file.

	* Some i18n fixes

2004-04-02  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Implement the point-on-curve checking.  The code should work,
	but the objects using it cannot be built yet.

2004-03-28  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add some non-functional code for point-on-curve checking.

2004-03-28  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* Add point styles

	* Some i18n fixes

	* More work on the DrGeo import filter

2004-03-27  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Apply a patch by Albert Astals Cid <tsdgeos@terra.es> that gives
	focus to the text input on first opening the text dialog.
	Closes:78409.

	* Fix a translation issue with internal macro's.

	* Make a TextImp transformable by simply transforming its
	location, and showing the text label in that location again
	(Closes: 78407 ).

2004-03-26  Pino Toscano <toscano.pino@tiscali.it>

	* Implemented a popup menu submenu for changing the line style of
	an object.
	
	* Various i18n fixes

2004-03-15  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* misc/coordinate_system.cpp: add a simple "Invisible" Coordinate
	system, showing no axes or grid at all.

2004-03-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Don't mess up the order of given objects in a macro
	construction.

2004-03-09  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix the macro system to reject macro's where not all of the
	given objects are used.

	* Fix the macro system to properly check whether the final objects
	depend on the given objects, and fix a problem with the wrong
	object being selected as the final object in some rare cases.

2004-03-06  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Incorporate a patch by Pino Toscano adding some unfinished work
	on a Dr.Geo import filter.  It's not finished yet, and also not
	visible in the UI yet.

	* Fix the ObjectHierarchy::resultDoesNotDependOnGiven() function
	to do something much less stupid than before.  It still only
	checks if one of the result objects does not depend on the given
	objects, it needs to be changed to properly check whether all the
	result objects depend on the given objects.

	* Fix the ObjectHierarchy class to generate a correct hierarchy 
	when a result object depends on another object that does not 
	depend on the given objects.

2004-02-24  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Make the tests stuff generate a proper text label with 
	property calcers instead of a normal calcer as rest arguments.

	* Make the configure.in.in stuff properly detect python on RH
	-> many thanks to Maurizio for helping me with this.

	* Fix some problems with the useText, that were introduced with 
	the new tests stuff.

2004-02-23  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add a ContainsTestType, testing whether a given point is on a
	given curve.

2004-02-17  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add the possibility to give an item a custom color in the 
	  popup dialog.

2004-02-16  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* make the usetext in TestConstructMode also appear for all other
	arguments than the last one

2004-02-15  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add code by Maurizio Paolini, and some adaptations of his code
	by me for supporting property tests like "are these two lines
	parallel ?"
	
	* update the aboutdata: Maurizio Paolini did not only help with
	math intensive code, and Franco Pasquarelli did some very
	important work in the locus code.

2004-02-14  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix a bug waiting to pop up in construct_mode.cc, where you
	select the same object twice.

	* Add documentation about the locus and textlabel design to the
	DESIGN document.

2004-02-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix a bug which caused Kig to crash on moving a text label by
	removing a wrong assertion in objects/object_calcer.cc

2004-02-09  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Replace the line-line-intersection algorithm with a much simpler
	one by Maurizio Paolini

	* Add three new transformations by Maurizio Paolini

	* Remove people-to-inform-about-kig-releases as no further
	separate releases are planned.

2004-02-08  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix a bug reported by Maurizio Paolini: don't crash on getting
	the arguments for a locus in the wrong order.

2004-01-21  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* replace my own autoconf code in configure.in.in for checking for
	boost.python and python by some macro's by Ben Burton which
	additionally check whether the python and boost.python combination
	found is sane.  They're also generally cleaner and such.

	* clean up configure.in.bot a bit

2004-01-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add a new internal "Segment Axis" type, implemented as a macro.

2004-01-18  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* bump the version number to 0.7.1

2003-12-16  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix the scrolling for horizontal scrolling using the alt button
	or a horizontal scroll wheel.

2003-12-15  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Another try at fixing the ArgsParser parsing order.  I think
	I've tried most problematic cases, and they all seem to work
	properly.  Let's pray for the best ;)

2003-12-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix a crash when using a macro having the moving point of a
	locus as its argument, reported by Marco Zoso.

2003-11-14  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix two crashes in TextLabelRedefineMode.

2003-11-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* bump the version number to 0.6.1

	* Fix bugs #67671 and #67694

2003-10-22  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Improve the errors given by the "New Script Wizard", by making
	it get a proper error description from the python interpreter.
	
	* fix the ArgsParser parsing order, properly this time..

2003-10-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Work on the Cabri import filter, so that it actually becomes
	usable for some easier files..

	* Improve the errors given by the "New Script Wizard", by making
	it get a proper error description from the python interpreter.

2003-10-09  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add a lot of documentation to the new classes.

	* Fix the moving system again, it now only redraws exactly those
	objects that need to be redrawn.  E.g. when a constrained point
	was moved, before it was assumed that all of its parents, and
	their children would move, whereas in reality, a constrained point
	does not move the curve it is constrained to.  This is now taken
	into account for.  This much optimizes the case where we move the
	constrained point in examples/sine-curve.kig.

	* Added a DESIGN document, documenting the Kig object system
	design.  I think that is rather finished now, and it's probably
	about time to try and make some other people than myself get it ;)

	* Remove support for the ancient pre-0.4 file format that we still
	supported opening.  If you still have old files around using it,
	you should convert them to the new format, by opening them with a
	Kig version between 0.4 to 0.6, and re-saving them.  Maintaining
	compatibility with these old files doesn't seem very useful,
	because I don't think there are many files in this format
	available, and therefore I didn't think it was worth the trouble
	of porting the code to the new object system.

	* Introduce a new file format that matches the new object system
	better.  Files in the old format can still be opened seamlessly.

	* Add undo/redo support for changing visible aspects of an object
	( size, color, shown state ).  In the new system, this was as easy
	as replacing the ObjectDrawer of an ObjectHolder with another one.

	* Another ( hopefully the last ) major change to the object
	system.  Decouple the link between how an object is calced and how
	it is drawn.  We now have a hierarchy structure of ObjectCalcer's
	describing various objects and their interrelations.  On top of
	that, there are the ObjectHolder's, which hold a link to an
	ObjectCalcer from the hierarchy, and keep an ObjectDrawer
	describing how to draw it.  The document only keeps a list of
	ObjectHolder's, nothing else..

	* make the New Script Wizard give an error when the script does
	not generate a valid ObjectImp.

	* fix some issues with the escaping of an & in a translatable
	string in an xml file

	* fix the generation of the pot translation template file

	* fix a problem with the order of arguments in ScalingOverLineType
	causing a test file to not be loaded correctly..

	* update some test files to the new ( post-0.4 ) kig file format.

	* add ( sometimes placeholder ) icons for the remaining actions
	that missed icons ( thanks to Maurizio Paolini )

2003-09-08  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Fix a bug that prevented Kig from opening its own files,
	rejecting them because they were of the 0.6.0 version, which Kig
	could not open..  I'm backporting this into Kig 0.6.0 and
	informing the packager..

	* clean up: Objects now store their parents in order, so that no
	parsing has to be done in the calc() function..  Also some more
	modifications making that function a bit simpler are included.
	Specifically, ArgsParser now does the checking of the arguments,
	instead of every single calc function doing it itself..

2003-09-02  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* rename ArgparserObjectType to ArgsParserObjectType

	* remove ArgsChecker class, and rename ArgParser to ArgsParser

2003-09-02  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* branch off Kig 0.6.0

2003-09-01  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* only move an object if its parents are not yet moving..  This
	fixes bug #63250.

	* remove the defective operator| and operator& implementations for
	the Objects class
	
2003-08-31  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* make the Kig Python Scripting API docs only available online.
	It's too much trouble to generate them during the build process,
	and I can't add a hard build-time dependency on doxygen anyway...

	* keep the Kig version number in a central place, so that it can
	easily be changed.  Use some autoconf magic to fill it in in the
	other places..

2003-08-25  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* update the configure.in.* files and remove
	README.boost-python1.30-gcc3.2 and boost-python1.30-gcc3.2.patch
	because distributing a Boost.Python patch with Kig is really
	stupid, and because the Debian packagers have already applied the
	patch in their version of Boost.Python, and so should the other
	distro's.  Seems I need to thank Ben Burton for suggesting to the
	Debian packagers to apply the patch.

	* fix a wrong "lib not found error" in configure.in.in by removing
	-pedantic from CXXFLAGS while trying to compile.

2003-08-15  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* improve the inline documentation in order to improve the doxygen
	generated docs for the python scripting API.

2003-08-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* give Transformation::apply better semantics

2003-07-27  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add a warning to configure.in.bot about how Boost.Python 1.30
	together with GCC 3.2+ is a bad combination, along with a patch.

	* add documentation about attaching text labels and locuses to the
	index.docbook file

2003-07-23  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add a nifty python scripting example that shows the graph of a
	sine curve, but can in fact be used to show any function's graph
	you would come up with.  It uses python scripting and the locus
	facility in a clever way to do this.  In fact, I stole the idea
	from something I saw Hilaire Fernandes do with the Dr.Genius guile
	scripting on a presentation at FOSDEM.  Kig - of course ;) - does
	it way cooler.. :)

	* add support for using the python math package in Kig python
	scripts, by importing it from PythonScripter's ctor, and by making
	Kig load its part library with RTLD_GLOBAL, to eliminate a problem
	which caused python to not be able to load its math dll..

2003-07-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add support for attached text labels.

2003-07-17  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the "conversion from const char* to char*" problem in
	python_scripter.cc.  This introduces a small, harmless memory leak
	because of how the python libs work..

2003-07-16  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add documentation about installing the python dev libs to
	configure.in.bot

	* adapt some infrastructure regarding text labels to be able to
	work with labels that get their location from an invisible Point
	object.  This will ease the adding of support for attached text
	labels..

2003-07-12  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* prevent a crash when kig cannot find its library.  It now just
	complains and exits properly.

2003-07-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add Python scripting support.  Rather large addition, involving
	a lot of autoconf and automake magic..

	* make snapToGrid work for PolarCoordinateSystem

	* make shift -> snap to grid work in PointConstructionMode and
	normal Construction Mode too..

	* add the concept of cache objects, which cannot be stored, in
	order to support a python compiled script ObjectImp..

2003-07-02  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* sanitize the ObjectImp inherits() system.  It now uses static
	objects instead of enum values, this also eliminates some ugly
	functions in ObjectImp, and allows for more flexible addition of
	new ObjectImp types..

	* fix a memory leak in KigDocument, which did not delete its
	KCommandHistory..

	* fix some use of uninitialised value in dragrectmode, which
	caused the dragrect to not work at random times

	* fix the clearing of the selection when the user clicks on an
	empty point..

2003-06-27  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* implement helpSlot() in ManageTypesDialog..

	* add a "Set Coordinate System" menu to the Settings menu..

	* make shift snap to grid in moving mode, and rework the moving
	API to something a bit saner in the process..

2003-06-25  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add undo support for various view actions like zoom in, zoom
	out, recenter screen, select screen rect etc.  Check out the
	comment in the function KigWidget::slotZoomIn() in
	kig/kig_view.cpp for why I implemented this even though it isn't
	really "correct".

2003-06-24  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix a crash bug reported by Pino Toscano, that occurs because
	TextLabelRedefineMode was not yet updated to the new
	reference-counting Object's stuff..

2003-06-21  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Implement Select all, Unselect all and Invert selection.

	
2003-06-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix this bug:"17) Add the possiblity, by pressing Esc, to stop
	the selection, even of the area to be shown."

	* add an icon for Arc's center property, this fixes: "12) Why
	don't you use baseCircle.png as icon to show/construct the center
	of a circle and (why not?) an arc?"

	* fix: a text label constructed using "add text label" from an
	object popup wasn't properly calced after construction..

	* fix this bug: "2) Add the possibility to set shortcut for all
	the actions & objects (For examples: Ctrl+P to construct a point,
	Ctrl+R to start a reflection, and so on...).", and add some
	default accels too ( "p" for point, "s" for segment etc. ( note :
	no control key ).

	* fix this bug: "3) When I select a segment, in his popup there are
	two same entry in Construct submenu, called Mid point an
	Midpoint. Why?" as reported by Pino Toscano
	

2003-06-11  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* move transformations to their own menu entry, thanks to Pino
		Toscano

	* move angle stuff to their own objects submenu, and toolbar,
		thanks to Pino Toscano

	* update the images in the docs, thanks to Pino Toscano

2003-06-04  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* show an appropriate error when trying to open an non-existing
		file..

	* clean up the object parent-child relation mechanism.  Rather
	large code cleanup, that simplifies a lot of code..  Needed a
	backwards-compatible file format extension.  This commit now also
	adds proper treatment of internal objects, because it no longer
	relies on the inherently wrong isInternal() hack, but features The
	Correct Fix(tm).

2003-06-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* bugfix: show default icons for actions that don't have any.. (
		fixes bug #59283 )

	* release Kig 0.5.1

2003-05-30  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add an option to select the part of the screen that should be
		shown by dragging a rect..

2003-05-28  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix warnings when compiling with --disable-debug

2003-05-26  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix a crash bug for a weird cubic situation

2003-05-25  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* implement another of Stephan Binner's suggestions: in the set
		coordinate system popup, show a checked mark next to the 
		current coordinate system..

	* fix a bug that caused the "circle by center and point" type to
		not be visible..

2003-05-24  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* when the user tries to construct a macro that constructs an
		object from its children, warn him instead of
		crashing... Thanks to Stephan Binner for the bug report

	* improve the export to image dialog, as suggested by Stephan Binner

2003-05-23  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* remove some obsolete code and clean some older code up..

2003-05-22  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add simple printing support using the fantastic KDE-Print lib

2003-05-21  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the full screen mode, to use the correct shortcut for
		starting and stopping it, and use QWidget::showFullScreen, instead
		of creating a full screen pseudo-dialog etc.

	* "branch off" release 0.5, and update the version strings etc.

2003-05-17  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add a toolbar icon ( i.e. GUIAction ) for constructing an angle
		bisector..

2003-05-15  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

	* take advantage of the new invalid coordinate when creating circles
		and arcs through three aligned points

2003-05-13  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix compilation with --enable-final

2003-05-12  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix a crash bug for macro's involving PropertyImp

	* update the AboutData: upgrade some people to authors, and add
		credit for some more people..  

	* add an angle bisector property

2003-05-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the transformation types for cases where the object being
		transformed is the same as one of the arguments that the
		transformation needs..  E.g. right-click on a
		point->transform->reflect over a point works properly
		point->transform->now.. 

2003-05-09  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

	* the drawLocus is now changed to function as a generic drawCurve.
		The changes are very little, and the locusCalcPoint is no
		longer necessary.  It seems that performance is not affected
		significantly.  The drawCubic is not used any longer; it is
		still there in kigpainter, but can be purged as soon as
		no problems arise with the new setup.  The generic drawCurve
		is used in place of drawCubic.

2003-05-08  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add support for quite some more types to the kseg import filter

2003-05-08  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

        * fixed drawing problem while building a cubic by 9 points.  The
		problem was located in calcCubicRoot when the degree is
		less than 3

2003-05-08  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add some properties to the arc object

	* organise the filters directory more sanely

	* fix for deleting: remove deleted objects from their children, so
		  they don't appear in saved files

2003-05-07  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* more undo support: redefining text labels and points is undoable
		  now..

	* small undo stuff cleanup

2003-05-06  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the change text action for text labels to reuse the label
		  construction dialog.  this makes it support multi-line
		  labels, and changing the parameters

2003-05-05  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add zoom in/out icons to the document popup menu

2003-05-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add support for multiline text labels..  still needs some
		  further work.. 

	* add a set size action to the angle type

	* change the angle size icon..

2003-05-03  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

	* add transformation support for arcs..

2003-05-02  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add undo support for changing the coordinate system

	* generalize the undo support from the moving mode, and add undo
		  support for many of the object specific actions.. 

2003-05-01  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* perfect the grid..
