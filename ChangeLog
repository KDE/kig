2003-08-25  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* update the configure.in.* files and remove
	README.boost-python1.30-gcc3.2 and boost-python1.30-gcc3.2.patch
	because distributing a Boost.Python patch with Kig is really
	stupid, and because the Debian packagers have already applied the
	patch in their version of Boost.Python, and so should the other
	distro's.  Seems I need to thank Ben Burton for suggesting to the
	Debian packagers to apply the patch.

	* fix a wrong "lib not found error" in configure.in.in by removing
	-pedantic from CXXFLAGS while trying to compile.

2003-08-15  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* improve the inline documentation in order to improve the doxygen
	generated docs for the python scripting API.

2003-08-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* give Transformation::apply better semantics

2003-07-27  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add a warning to configure.in.bot about how Boost.Python 1.30
	together with GCC 3.2+ is a bad combination, along with a patch.

	* add documentation about attaching text labels and locuses to the
	index.docbook file

2003-07-23  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add a nifty python scripting example that shows the graph of a
	sine curve, but can in fact be used to show any function's graph
	you would come up with.  It uses python scripting and the locus
	facility in a clever way to do this.  In fact, I stole the idea
	from something I saw Hilaire Fernandes do with the Dr.Genius guile
	scripting on a presentation at FOSDEM.  Kig - of course ;) - does
	it way cooler.. :)

	* add support for using the python math package in Kig python
	scripts, by importing it from PythonScripter's ctor, and by making
	Kig load its part library with RTLD_GLOBAL, to eliminate a problem
	which caused python to not be able to load its math dll..

2003-07-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add support for attached text labels.

2003-07-17  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the "conversion from const char* to char*" problem in
	python_scripter.cc.  This introduces a small, harmless memory leak
	because of how the python libs work..

2003-07-16  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add documentation about installing the python dev libs to
	configure.in.bot

	* adapt some infrastructure regarding text labels to be able to
	work with labels that get their location from an invisible Point
	object.  This will ease the adding of support for attached text
	labels..

2003-07-12  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* prevent a crash when kig cannot find its library.  It now just
	complains and exits properly.

2003-07-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add Python scripting support.  Rather large addition, involving
	a lot of autoconf and automake magic..

	* make snapToGrid work for PolarCoordinateSystem

	* make shift -> snap to grid work in PointConstructionMode and
	normal Construction Mode too..

	* add the concept of cache objects, which cannot be stored, in
	order to support a python compiled script ObjectImp..

2003-07-02  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* sanitize the ObjectImp inherits() system.  It now uses static
	objects instead of enum values, this also eliminates some ugly
	functions in ObjectImp, and allows for more flexible addition of
	new ObjectImp types..

	* fix a memory leak in KigDocument, which did not delete its
	KCommandHistory..

	* fix some use of uninitialised value in dragrectmode, which
	caused the dragrect to not work at random times

	* fix the clearing of the selection when the user clicks on an
	empty point..

2003-06-27  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* implement helpSlot() in ManageTypesDialog..

	* add a "Set Coordinate System" menu to the Settings menu..

	* make shift snap to grid in moving mode, and rework the moving
	API to something a bit saner in the process..

2003-06-25  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add undo support for various view actions like zoom in, zoom
	out, recenter screen, select screen rect etc.  Check out the
	comment in the function KigWidget::slotZoomIn() in
	kig/kig_view.cpp for why I implemented this even though it isn't
	really "correct".

2003-06-24  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix a crash bug reported by Pino Toscano, that occurs because
	TextLabelRedefineMode was not yet updated to the new
	reference-counting Object's stuff..

2003-06-21  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Implement Select all, Unselect all and Invert selection.

	
2003-06-20  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix this bug:"17) Add the possiblity, by pressing Esc, to stop
	the selection, even of the area to be shown."

	* add an icon for Arc's center property, this fixes: "12) Why
	don't you use baseCircle.png as icon to show/construct the center
	of a circle and (why not?) an arc?"

	* fix: a text label constructed using "add text label" from an
	object popup wasn't properly calced after construction..

	* fix this bug: "2) Add the possibility to set shortcut for all
	the actions & objects (For examples: Ctrl+P to construct a point,
	Ctrl+R to start a reflection, and so on...).", and add some
	default accels too ( "p" for point, "s" for segment etc. ( note :
	no control key ).

	* fix this bug: "3) When I select a segment, in his popup there are
	two same entry in Construct submenu, called Mid point an
	Midpoint. Why?" as reported by Pino Toscano
	

2003-06-11  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* move transformations to their own menu entry, thanks to Pino
		Toscano

	* move angle stuff to their own objects submenu, and toolbar,
		thanks to Pino Toscano

	* update the images in the docs, thanks to Pino Toscano

2003-06-04  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* show an appropriate error when trying to open an non-existing
		file..

	* clean up the object parent-child relation mechanism.  Rather
	large code cleanup, that simplifies a lot of code..  Needed a
	backwards-compatible file format extension.  This commit now also
	adds proper treatment of internal objects, because it no longer
	relies on the inherently wrong isInternal() hack, but features The
	Correct Fix(tm).

2003-06-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* bugfix: show default icons for actions that don't have any.. (
		fixes bug #59283 )

	* release Kig 0.5.1

2003-05-30  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* Add an option to select the part of the screen that should be
		shown by dragging a rect..

2003-05-28  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix warnings when compiling with --disable-debug

2003-05-26  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix a crash bug for a weird cubic situation

2003-05-25  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* implement another of Stephan Binner's suggestions: in the set
		coordinate system popup, show a checked mark next to the 
		current coordinate system..

	* fix a bug that caused the "circle by center and point" type to
		not be visible..

2003-05-24  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* when the user tries to construct a macro that constructs an
		object from its children, warn him instead of
		crashing... Thanks to Stephan Binner for the bug report

	* improve the export to image dialog, as suggested by Stephan Binner

2003-05-23  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* remove some obsolete code and clean some older code up..

2003-05-22  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add simple printing support using the fantastic KDE-Print lib

2003-05-21  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the full screen mode, to use the correct shortcut for
		starting and stopping it, and use QWidget::showFullScreen, instead
		of creating a full screen pseudo-dialog etc.

	* "branch off" release 0.5, and update the version strings etc.

2003-05-17  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add a toolbar icon ( i.e. GUIAction ) for constructing an angle
		bisector..

2003-05-15  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

	* take advantage of the new invalid coordinate when creating circles
		and arcs through three aligned points

2003-05-13  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix compilation with --enable-final

2003-05-12  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix a crash bug for macro's involving PropertyImp

	* update the AboutData: upgrade some people to authors, and add
		credit for some more people..  

	* add an angle bisector property

2003-05-10  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the transformation types for cases where the object being
		transformed is the same as one of the arguments that the
		transformation needs..  E.g. right-click on a
		point->transform->reflect over a point works properly
		point->transform->now.. 

2003-05-09  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

	* the drawLocus is now changed to function as a generic drawCurve.
		The changes are very little, and the locusCalcPoint is no
		longer necessary.  It seems that performance is not affected
		significantly.  The drawCubic is not used any longer; it is
		still there in kigpainter, but can be purged as soon as
		no problems arise with the new setup.  The generic drawCurve
		is used in place of drawCubic.

2003-05-08  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add support for quite some more types to the kseg import filter

2003-05-08  Maurizio Paolini  <paolini@dmf.unicatt.it>

        * fixed drawing problem while building a cubic by 9 points.  The
		problem was located in calcCubicRoot when the degree is
		less than 3

2003-05-08  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add some properties to the arc object

	* organise the filters directory more sanely

	* fix for deleting: remove deleted objects from their children, so
		  they don't appear in saved files

2003-05-07  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* more undo support: redefining text labels and points is undoable
		  now..

	* small undo stuff cleanup

2003-05-06  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* fix the change text action for text labels to reuse the label
		  construction dialog.  this makes it support multi-line
		  labels, and changing the parameters

2003-05-05  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add zoom in/out icons to the document popup menu

2003-05-03  Dominique Devriese  <devriese@kde.org>

	* add support for multiline text labels..  still needs some
		  further work..
