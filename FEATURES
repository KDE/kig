FEATURES
here are some nice Kig features i'd like to show off :)
- macro's: if you want to try, open macrotest.kig, then click the 
  button to the left of the fullscreen button, select the three
  corners of the triangle, then click the button again, click the
  circle, click the button again, type in a name.  Then check out the
  new type with the other circle types.  You can't really see the
  difference between built-in types and macro's
- you see stuff as you're constructing it: to try: construct a new
  LineTTP 
- is a KPart: try opening macrotest.kig from konqueror, if it doesn't 
  work yet, open your kcontrol, then go to "File Browsing"->"File
  Associations", click add, group:"application", name:"x-kig", open
  the "embedding" tab page for the new type, click "add", find
  "KigPart" (if you installed Kig correctly (did you get the
  "--prefix" on your configure right?) , it should be there), and add
  it. then try opening macrotest.kig again
- saves in a clean xml format
- recently, i added support for Locuses, this is another thing from
  KSeg which i also implemented in my program.  It's a very cool idea,
  and it supports rather advanded stuff like conic's in an easy (for
  the developer :) way...
  To see it work, check out the conic5pt.kigt and locustest.kig files
  (the first is based on the latter...
- Kig also supports various file formats... Currently i have only
  implemented read support for simple KGeo files yet, but i am
  planning on extending this to read/write support for KGeo, KSeg and
  Cabri files (maybe others too ?).
