FEATURES
here are some nice Kig features i'd like to show off :)
- macro's: if you want to try, open macrotest.kig, then click the
button to the left of the fullscreen button, select the three corners
of the triangle, then click the button again, click the circle, click
the button again, type in a name.  Then check out the new type with
the other circle types.  Notice that you can't really see the
difference between built-in types and macro's
- you see stuff as you're drawing it: to try: construct a new LineTTP
- is a KPart: try opening macrotest.kig from konqueror, if it doesn't
work yet, open your kcontrol, then go to "File Browsing"->"File
Associations", click add, group:"application", name:"x-kig", open the
"embedding" tab page for the new type, click "add", find "KigPart"
(if you installed Kig correctly (did you get the "--prefix" on your
configure right?) , it should be there), and add it. then try opening
macrotest.kig again
- saves in an xml format -> i'm still going to improve this when i'll be
adding koffice support
