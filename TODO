* reimplement
- macro management:
	1 get rid of CustomTypes by putting their data in DataObjects
	2 start a plugin system.  A Plugin class keeps pointers to the
	  ObjectConstructor's, GUIAction's, ObjectType's etc. that it
	  is responsible for.  An ObjectType keeps a reference count, 
	  there should prolly be an OrphanedObjectTypes thing for 
	  plugins that are unloaded when their ObjectType was still in 
	  use.  There will be at least one type of plugin: macro's, 
	  maybe someday i'll add dll's and script plugins.  maybe i should 
	  put the builtin types in a plugin ( either a dll or a pseudo-plugin
	  or sth like that ).  There will be a list of all plugins somewhere, 
	  and something like the old TypesDialog will allow the user to
	  manage them.  Macro's have special possibilities, they can be 
	  saved etc., so i need to figure out how to deal with this..
	  plugins can be loaded, unloaded etc.
- rmb menu's

* simple:
- implement the helpSlot()'s in the wizards..

* harder:
- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, kseg
   support... )  and output filters...  
- implement Circle by center and radius
- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- Finally fix the move dependencies... i am thinking of making
   Object::startMove() into Object::startMove( Objects& ).  Objects
   could decide on what objects are already moving how they will move,
   and they add themselves and other things they will be moving to the
   Objects variable.  This should finally fix the move dependencies, i
   think... 
- move stillPix into movingMode, so the other modes won't suffer from
   its overhead...
- add full undo support for everything the user might do

* hard :
- scripting !  The GNOME Interactive Geometry program Dr. Genius seems
   to have this already ( albeit in Guile ;) ), so Kig can't lag
   behind ;) 
- figure out some cool way to "attach" a textlabel to an object.. 
- koffice support ? 

* future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
   exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.
   I'm thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but
   this is _distant_ future.. )
