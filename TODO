- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- objects:
	ray
	arc
	ellipse
	pointonline
- locuses -> cf. KSeg
- koffice support !
- i just had an idea for speeding up drawin, the idea is that we
extend qpainter to support for saving a sequence of bits:
e.g. drawEllipse is extended with saveEllipse, which saves the colours
on the place where the ellipse will be drawn, there would of course be
the inverse. In practice an object would save what's on the screen
before it is drawn, then draw itself, and when it should draw again,
it first restores what was under it before it started.  this would
make some other stuff obsolete like the getOverlay stuff which i just
got to work quite nice... Anyway, this will be something for a later
release, if i ever implement it... 
I'll have to write myself a subclass for QPainter for this, prolly
without anti-aliasing.

- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.  I'm
thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + JavaScript (KJS, which i
extend to support my own DOM (Document Object Model)).
