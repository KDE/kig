simple:
- implement the helpSlot()'s in the wizards..
- change resizeEvent to not recenter the screen..
- rearrange some of the icons to match KGeo's appearance..

harder:
- fix the KDE style issues, there are quite some problems, i guess i
  should try out kdenonbeta/scheck ...
- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, kseg
  support... )  and output filters...
- implement Circle by center and radius
- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- Finally fix the move dependencies... i am thinking of making
  Object::startMove() into Object::startMove( Objects& ).  Objects
  could decide on what objects are already moving how they will move,
  and they add themselves and other things they will be moving to the
  Objects variable.  This should finally fix the move dependencies, i
  think... 
- move stillPix into movingMode, so the other modes won't suffer from
  its overhead...  

hard :
- rework Macro support into something simpler: make it into types that
  simply add a lot of normal ( as in: builtin ) objects instead of one
  ugly object of the Macro class ( which, erm.. sucks :)
- scripting !  The GNOME Interactive Geometry program Dr. Genius seems
  to have this already ( albeit in Guile ;) ), so Kig can't lag behind
  ;)
- figure out some cool way to "attach" a textlabel to an object..
- koffice support ?

future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
  exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.  I'm
  thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but this is
  _distant_ future.. )
