* not too hard:

- add support for working with angles in degrees in the set size
  dialog of an angle..

- add support for giving sizes in cm, inches in the export to image
  dialog..

- add an option to change the name and description of a type in the
  "manage types" dialog..

* harder:

- decouple the link between how an object is calc'ed and whether or
  not it is drawn.  This will require another file format change, I
  think..

- undo support for changing the size and color of an object ( depends
  on the previous item )..

- make the python scripting work more like the macro system.  Make it
  a way to define new object types that can be reused more than once,
  instead of making it just a way to add *one* object..

- support for more scripting languages than just python..

- fillable polygons/shapes..

- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, Dr.Genius
  perhaps )

* hard :

- figure out a way to allow the user to enable and disable certain
  features.  E.g. I have been asked to allow the user to limit himself
  to compass-ruler constructions..

- check "property's", like "is point x on line y"

- "export to *".  We already have images and XFig files, i'd like to
  add stuff like java applets etc ... :)

- koffice support ? 

- add another viewmode ( which would be completely orthogonal to the
  KigMode concept ), where you can more clearly see the dependencies
  in a figure.  Something with colours, numberings, and/or a tree-like
  text representation of the dependencies..

* future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
   exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.
   I'm thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but
   this is _distant_ future.. )
