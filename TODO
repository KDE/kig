* very necessary

- save and load ObjectDrawer styles !

* not too hard:

- add ObjectType's to the ObjectTypeFactory automatically.

- create a ObjectImp::surroundingRect function, and use it in
   calculating the preferred screen size

- make it possible to zoom to a very specific part of the screen,
   i.e. from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1)

- export vectors and cubics to the python scripting stuff...

- add support for working with angles in degrees in the set size
  dialog of an angle..

- add support for work with other measure units (cm, inches, etc...)
  than just pixels...

- add an option to change the name and description of a type in the
  "manage types" dialog..

- add an option to the objects popup to start a script object with the
  current object as first argument...

- implement cut, copy and paste for objects...

* harder:

- rework the ObjectConstructor and GUIAction stuff into something more
   general, and more clean.  See the comment for
   ObjectConstructor::constructMode().

- make the dialogs not pop up over the main window..

- make the scripting system work more like the macro system. Make it
  a way to define new object types that can be reused more than once,
  instead of making it just a way to add *one* object..

- support for more scripting languages than just python..

- fillable polygons/shapes..

- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat ), improve
  and activate Dr. Geo filter ( see filters/drgeo-filter-status.txt )

* hard :

- figure out a way to allow the user to enable and disable certain
  features.  E.g. I have been asked to allow the user to limit himself
  to compass-ruler constructions..

- "export to *": add stuff like java applets, SVG documents, etc...

- koffice w/o OpenOffice.org support ?

- add another viewmode ( which would be completely orthogonal to the
  KigMode concept ), where you can more clearly see the dependencies
  in a figure.  Something with colours, numberings, and/or a tree-like
  text representation of the dependencies..

* future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
   exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.
   I'm thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but
   this is _distant_ future.. )
