* more or less urgently necessary

- document mathematical i18n strings, so that the translators have a
   clue about how to translate them !

* not too hard:

- Provide some nice stuff for differential geometry: velocity vector
   of a curve, curvature vector, osculating parabole, osculating
   circle, evolute.  Most of this is fairly trivial to implement, but
   very cool :)

- a test for checking if two vectors are equal ( this is trivial ).

- let the user select where the vector sum starts, instead of drawing
   it in the start point of the first vector.

- add support for work via command line without GUI. Possible options
  and uses:<br />
  -c, --convert-to-native filename.ext => Kig will convert the file in its own
  format and output the file filename.kig<br /> ( domi: done )
  -e, --export-to FORMAT file.kig => Kig will export file.kig ( or any
  other supported format ) into file.ext ( even more than one file ).
  The output format depends on the FORMAT string. domi: this is more
  difficult, because the export plugins require extra parameters.
  E.g. the ImageExporter needs an image size etc.

- make stuff from RMB menu's accessible from other places as well.

- write *-filter-status.txt's for the kseg and cabri filters.

- Three new transformations: projection on a line, orthogonally and
  according to a given direction, and a similitude ( homothecy +
  rotation ).

- When selecting an argument of a certain type, show something like
   "Select a vector", so that the user is not confused, looking for an
   object he can't find ( maybe using a side list with an arrow for every
   step of the construction and a KToggleAction like "Settings->Show Side
   List" to show/hide it ).  In addition, maybe we should check
   whether the required arguments are really there, before telling the
   user to select them.  Then we could give an error telling the user
   to first construct the other objects.  An exception should be made
   for points of course.

- Add the possibility to attach text label also to angles and vectors.

- Add the possibility to select, via new dialog, one or more types of
  object.

- add "Tools": easy tools designed for geometry, like Angle converter and
  so on...

- add intersection type between arcs and the other objects.

- add ObjectType's to the ObjectTypeFactory automatically.

- make it possible to zoom to a very specific part of the screen,
   i.e. from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1)

- Python scripting: export cubics, improve existing API.

- add support for work with other measure units (cm, inches, etc...)
  than just pixels...

- add an option to change the name and description of a type in the
  "manage types" dialog..

- add an option to the objects popup to start a script object with the
  current object as first argument...

- implement cut, copy and paste for objects...

* harder:

- allow editing of python scripts

- give objects names

- allow for using kformula w/o OOFormula w/o MathML formulas in the
  document.

- rework the ObjectConstructor and GUIAction stuff into something more
   general, and more clean.  See the comment for
   ObjectConstructor::constructMode().

- make the dialogs not pop up over the main window..

- make the scripting system work more like the macro system. Make it
  a way to define new object types that can be reused more than once,
  instead of making it just a way to add *one* object..

- support for more scripting languages than just python..

- fillable polygons/shapes..

- filters: more input filters, improve Cabri filter and Dr. Geo filter
  ( see filters/drgeo-filter-status.txt ), add the possibility to ignore
  errors on loading

* hard :

- save a "session", i.e.: record how a document is moved, and save it to
  e.g. a flash file or something like that.

- figure out a way to allow the user to enable and disable certain
  features.  E.g. I have been asked to allow the user to limit himself
  to compass-ruler constructions..

- "export to *": add stuff like java applets, SVG documents, latex, etc...

- koffice w/o OpenOffice.org support ?

- add another viewmode ( which would be completely orthogonal to the
  KigMode concept ), where you can more clearly see the dependencies
  in a figure.  Something with colours, numberings, and/or a tree-like
  text representation of the dependencies..

- defined integrals, as a particular case of filled shapes...

* future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
   exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.
   I'm thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but
   this is _distant_ future.. )
