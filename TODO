- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- objects:
	ray
	arc
	ellipse
- locuses -> cf. KSeg
	--> this is implemented (objects/locus.cpp), but can still be
            improved upon quite a lot...
- koffice support !
- i had an idea for speeding up drawing, the idea is that we
extend qpainter to support for saving a sequence of bits:
e.g. drawEllipse is extended with saveEllipse, which saves the colours
on the place where the ellipse will be drawn, there would of course be
the inverse. In practice an object would save what's on the screen
before it is drawn, then draw itself, and when it should draw again,
it first restores what was under it before it started.
I'll have to write a subclass for QPainter for this, prolly without
anti-aliasing

- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.  I'm
thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + Scripting (i'm working on
a widget for scripting which would be usable throughout kde...

- transformations like in KSeg...

- Finally fix the move dependencies...

- think about what to do with coincident points..

- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, kseg
support... )  and output filters...

- saving/printing to image files -> "export to image"
