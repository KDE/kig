- rework Macro support into something simpler: make it into types that
  simply add a lot of normal ( as in: builtin ) objects instead of one
  ugly object of the Macro class ( which, erm.. sucks :)
- implement Circle by center and radius
- rearrange some of the icons to match KGeo's appearance..
- figure out some cool way to "attach" a textlabel to an object..
- move stillPix into movingMode, so the other modes won't suffer from
  its overhead...  
- Finally fix the move dependencies... i am thinking of making
  Object::startMove() into Object::startMove( Objects& ).  Objects
  could decide on what objects are already moving how they will move,
  and they add themselves and other things they will be moving to the
  Objects variable.  This should finally fix the move dependencies, i
  think... 
- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- koffice support ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
  exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.  I'm
  thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + Scripting ( but this is
  _distant_ future.. )  
- transformations like in KSeg...
- think about what to do with coincident points..
- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, kseg
  support... )  and output filters...
- Add a CollectionObject: this object holds a list of subobjects.  The
  user sees this in a way that right-clicking a selection shows a rmb
  option group, and rmb'ing a collectionObject shows a split
  option...  There are a few behavioural problems with this; I'm still
  thinking about what it would take to implement this...
