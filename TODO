- move stillPix into movingMode, so the other modes won't suffer from
  its overhead...  
- Finally fix the move dependencies... i am thinking of making
  Object::startMove() into Object::startMove( Objects& ).  Objects
  could decide on what objects are already moving how they will move,
  and they add themselves and other things they will be moving to the
  Objects variable.  This should finally fix the move dependencies, i
  think... 
- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- exporting to image formats ( preferably not via printing, cause
  printing doesn't allow you to specify the image size, the file
  format etc.
- object labels !!! think about some generic way to do this...
- locuses -> cf. KSeg
    --> this is implemented (objects/locus.cpp), but can still be
    	improved upon quite a lot...
- koffice support ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
  exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.  I'm
  thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + Scripting ( but this is
  _distant_ future.. )  
- transformations like in KSeg...
- think about what to do with coincident points..
- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, kseg
  support... )  and output filters...
- Add a CollectionObject: this object holds a list of subobjects.  The
  user sees this in a way that right-clicking a selection shows a rmb
  option group, and rmb'ing a collectionObject shows a split option...
