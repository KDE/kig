* harder:
- add a redefine action to text labels..
- multiline text labels..
- set the size of an angle, like set length for segments..
- decouple the link between how an object is calc'ed and whether or
  not it is internal or drawn.  ( all combinations are possible,
  except that internal objects are never drawn ).  Internal objects
  should be differentiated by holding them in a separate container at
  the KigPart level, I think..  This will require another file format
  change, I think..
- split up the transformation types as follows: they only generate a
  TransformationImp, and the real transforming is done by the
  ApplyTransformationType..  This is dependent on the previous TODO.
- fillable polygons..
- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, Dr.Genius
  perhaps ) and output filters...   
- implement Circle by center and radius
- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- move stillPix into movingMode, so the other modes won't suffer from
   its overhead...
- add full undo support for everything the user might do: moving is
  done, along with some other things, some less important issues remain

* hard :
- figure out a way to allow the user to enable and disable certain
  features.  E.g. I have been asked to allow the user to limit himself
  to compass-ruler constructions..
- scripting !  The GNOME Interactive Geometry program Dr. Genius seems
   to have this already ( albeit in Guile ;) ), so Kig can't lag
   behind ;) 
- check "property's", like "is point x on line y"
- "export to *".  We already have images and XFig files, i'd like to
  add stuff like java applets etc ... :)
- figure out some cool way to "attach" a textlabel to an object.. 
- koffice support ? 

* future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
   exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.
   I'm thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but
   this is _distant_ future.. )
