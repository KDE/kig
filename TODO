* reimplement
- rmb menu's

* simple:
- implement the helpSlot()'s in the wizards..
- get rid of CustomTypes by putting their data in DataObjects

* harder:
- filters: more input filters ( get cabri to work somewhat, kseg
   support... )  and output filters...  
- implement Circle by center and radius
- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- Finally fix the move dependencies... i am thinking of making
   Object::startMove() into Object::startMove( Objects& ).  Objects
   could decide on what objects are already moving how they will move,
   and they add themselves and other things they will be moving to the
   Objects variable.  This should finally fix the move dependencies, i
   think... 
- move stillPix into movingMode, so the other modes won't suffer from
   its overhead...
- add full undo support for everything the user might do

* hard :
- figure out a way to allow the user to enable and disable certain
  features.  E.g. I have been asked to allow the user to limit himself
  to compass-ruler constructions..
- scripting !  The GNOME Interactive Geometry program Dr. Genius seems
   to have this already ( albeit in Guile ;) ), so Kig can't lag
   behind ;) 
- figure out some cool way to "attach" a textlabel to an object.. 
- koffice support ? 

* future ?
- there should be a way to link a figure to a (html?) file containing
   exercises.  Teachers would be able to create exercises for Kig.
   I'm thinking of doing this with HTML (& KHTML) + scripting ( but
   this is _distant_ future.. )
