- printing... (cf. the kdeprint tutorial on printing.kde.org ...
- objects:
	ray
	arc
	ellipse
	pointonline
- locuses -> cf. KSeg
- koffice support !
- i just had another idea for speeding up drawing (imagine moving objects without shocky movement :), the idea is that we extend qpainter to support for saving a sequence of bits: e.g. drawEllipse is extended with saveEllipse, which saves the colors on the place where the ellipse will be drawn, there would of course be the inverse.
In practice an object would save what's on the screen before it is drawn, then draw itself, and when it should draw again, it first restores what was under it before it started.  this would make some other stuff obsolete like the getOverlay stuff which i just got to work quite nice... Anyway, this will be something for a later release, if i ever implement it...
I'll have to write myself a subclass for QPainter for this, maybe without anti-aliasing.
