Objects to implement
--------------------

Points            Coordinate(*)
Lines             pt_slope(*)
Circle            radius(*)
Numberics         distance_pt_line, distance_pt_circle
Angles            vectors
Polygons          also in Kig
Transformations   scaling(*)
Intersections     arc-line (also in Kig)
boundingBox       temporarily ignored

(*) objects which depend on numerics

Known problems
--------------

* Angle(3pts): no label with measure
* Point(On_curve): works only with segments, circles and arcs (I hope)
* Locus(None): style attribute not taken into account
